\title{Download a file, using http, https, or ftp}
\usage{
download(url, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{url}{The URL to download.}

\item{...}{Other arguments that are passed to \code{\link{download.file}}.}
}
\description{
This is a wrapper for \code{\link{download.file}} and takes all the same
arguments. The only difference is that, if the protocol is https, it changes
some settings to make it work. How exactly the settings are changed
differs among platforms.
}
\details{
This function also should follow http redirects on all platforms, which is
something that does not happen by default when \code{curl} is used, as on
Mac OS X.

With Windows, it calls \code{setInternet2}, which tells R to use the
\code{internet2.dll}. Then it downloads the file by calling
\code{\link{download.file}} using the \code{"internal"} method.

On other platforms, it will try to use \code{wget}, then \code{curl}, and
then \code{lynx} to download the file. Typically, Linux platforms will have
\code{wget} installed, and Mac OS X will have \code{curl}.

Note that for many (perhaps most) types of files, you will want to use
\code{mode="wb"} so that the file is downloaded in binary mode.

\dontrun{
# Download the downloader source, in binary mode
download("https://github.com/wch/downloader/zipball/master",
         "downloader.zip", mode = "wb")

}
\seealso{
\code{\link{download.file}} for more information on the arguments
  that can be used with this function.
